# Origin of Bioelectric Signals


1. Source of bioelectric potential is ionic in nature. The prominent ions are
   K+, Na+ and Cl-.

   Electrodes make the transfer from the ionic conduction in the tissue to the
   electronic conduction which is necessary to make measurements.

1. Palsied muscles mean paralyzed muscle

1. The principle ion that is not involved with the phenomena of producing
   cell potential is 
   - [ ] Na+
   - [ ] K+
   - [ ] Cl-
   - [X] H+


1. What is the relatively static membrane potential of quiescent cells called?
   [Cell potential of inactive cells]
    - [ ] half-cell potential
    - [ ] action potential
    - [X] resting membrane potential
    - [ ] cell potential


1. Variation of electric potential associated with the passage of a pulse along
   the membrane of a muscle cell or a nerve cell is called
    - [ ] Muscle potential
    - [X] action potential
    - [ ] resting potential
    - [ ] half cell potential

1. Cells depolarize and action potential generated as soon as stimulus is
   applied.
    - [ ] True
    - [X] False
    A threshold needs to be attained.

1. After a cell is stimulated a finite period of time is required for the cell
   to return to its pre-stimulus state. This period is known as 
    - [ ] A
    - [ ] refactory period
    - [ ] C
    - [ ] D

1. Phonocardiography is listening to  
    - [ ] A
    - [ ] B
    - [ ] heart sounds
    - [ ] D

1. Deep seated electrodes indicates the electric potential difference arising
   inside the living tissues or cells 
    - [ ] A
    - [ ] B
    - [ ] C
    - [ ] D

1. Impedance pneumography is a commonly used technique to monitor a person's
   respiration rate. 
    - [ ] A
    - [ ] B
    - [ ] C
    - [ ] D

1. What is the frequency range of ECG? 
    - [X] 0.05-120 Hz; Signal amplitude: 0.1 - 5mV, typical signal: 1mV

1. What is the signal amplitude range of EEG? 
    - [X] 2-200 \micro V,
    - total :0.5-50Hz
    - delta: 0.5 - 4Hz - sleeping
    - theta: 4-8 Hz
    - alpha 8 - 13Hz - awake but inactive (alertness)
    - beta 13 - 22Hz    - active


1. In voluntary contraction of the skeletal muscles, the muscle potential
   ranges from 50uV to 5mV

1. Needle electrode is used to measure EMG.

1. From equipment POV, the respiratory system in the human body is pneumatic
   system in which air pump (diaphragm) alternately creates negative and
   positive pressures in a sealed chamber (thoracic cavity) and causes air to
   be sucked into and forced out of a pair of elastic bags (pneuma).

1. From equipment POV, the blood circulation system (or heart) in the human
   body is a hydraullic system.

1. Off-set potential is  
    - [X] difference in half-cell potentials between two electrodes
    - [ ] sum of half-cell potential between two electrodes
    - [ ] average of half-cell potential between two electrodes
    - [ ] complement of half-cell potentials between two electrodes

1. Which electrodes can work even after being induced to large electric
   discharge such as defibrillation? 
    - [ ] A
    - [ ] B
    - [ ] non-polarizing electrodes
    - [ ] D

    Non-polarizing electrodes are designed to rapidly dissipate any charge
    imbalance induced by powerful electric discharge such as a defibrillation
    procedure. Rapid depolarization enables the immediate reappearance of
    bioelectric signals on the monitor after defibrillation. 
    Ag-AgCl electrodes are an example of non-polarized electrodes.

1. ECG was invented by 
    - [X] Willem Einthoven in 1903
    - [ ] Robert Koch
    - [ ] Werner Forssmann
    - [ ] Gertrude B.Elion

1. The interior of the neuron is at a potential of about -70mV relative to the
   exterior.

1. Triscuspid valve is also called right atrio-ventricular valve because it is
   placed between right atrium and ventricle. In consists of three flaps or
   cusps that prevents backward flow of blood from right ventricle to right
   atrium.

1. SA node is located in the top right atrium near the entry of the venacava.

1. AV node is located at the lower part of the heart wall between the two
   atria. The AV node delays spread of excitation for about 0.12s due to the
   presence of a fibrous barrier of non-excitable cells that effectively
   prevent its propagation from continuing beyond the limits of stria.

1. The basic functional unit of nervous system is  
    - [ ] nerves
    - [ ] axon
    - [X] neuron
    - [ ] dendrite


1. Buffer amplifier converts high impedance signals to low impedance signals.

1. Mono polar needle electrodes have a coat of teflon over the stainless steel
   wires which are bare only at the tips.

1. According to the international 10/20 system to measure EEG, even number
   denotes which side of the brain? 
   - [] left
   - [x] right
   - [] bottom
   - [] top


1. Disturbance in the EEG pattern resulting from the EEG pattern resulting from
   the external stimuli is called evoked response.
