## X-rays

### Production 

- Requirements for X-ray production:  
    1. A source of electrons such as a heated filament. (Cathode)  
    1. A target i.e. an area to bombard the electrons upon. (Anode)
        - Tungsten (W)
        - Molybdenum, Rhodium as target in conventional mammography.
    1. A means to accelerate (with extremely high velocity) the electrons
       produced from the source to the target. The "means" is usually an
       external energy source such as potential difference between the source
       and the target that ranges from +30kV to +150kV (in modern X-ray tubes).
    1. High vacuum, otherwise electrons liberated from the cathode may interact
       with air on its way to the anode. (Absolute vacuum is not possible).

- Electrons released from the cathode gain KE (keV equivalent to the applied
  voltage) as they are accelerated towards the anode. However, the applied
  potential is AC, so the polarity of the anode and cathode changes
  periodically. The electrons will traverse the length of the X-ray tube from
  cathode to anode only when the anode is more positive with respect to the
  cathode. To counter this, modern X-ray machines make use of rectifiers to
  render the anode more positive than cathode in any case. Moreover, the
  applied voltage fluctuates rapidly between $0$ and peak voltage $+kV_p$ (peak)
  and as a result the energy of each electrons emitted will also vary. As
  electrons liberated from the cathode strike the anode, 99% of the energy is
  converted into heat energy and only remaining 1% is converted to X-ray.
    
- Two types of X-ray production:
    1. Bremsstrahlung (or Brems) X-ray Production
        - Interaction of emitted $e^-$ with protons and nucleus in the anode.
        - When an $e^-$ travels towards the nucleus of a W atom, the protons in
          the nucleus of the W atom (try to) pull the $e^-$ towards itself due
          to coulomb's force of attraction.
        - However, since $e^-$ has very high velocity, the electron gets
          deviated such that the $e^-$ changes its course (loci), losing some
          of its energy (heat + radiation: conservation of energy) in the
          process. Because there are 74 protons in the nucleus of a W atom,
          this phenomena will iterate until the $e^-$ is completely energy
          less.
        - Energy lost by the $e^-$ will gradually increase as it travels
          farther into the nuclear field of the W atom (because force is
          inversely proportional to the square of the distance; kudos to
          Coulombs). The inherent construction of modern X-ray tube is such
          that its material will absorb X-ray photons with lower energy.

    1. Characteristic X-ray Production
        - Interaction of emitted $e^-$ with $e^-$ in the anode.
        - In diagnostic radiology, characteristic X-rays have no significance.
          Applications in X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. XRF is used in
          a wide range of applications, including environmental analysis,
          materials science, and forensic science.
        - The electrons travelling from the source may strike an $e^-$ present
          at the orbital of the W atom. If an incident $e^-$ posses energy,
          greater than of the $e^-$ at the orbital, it will knock the $e^-$
          atom out from its shell, which renders the W atom unstable. As a
          result, an $e^-$ from higher energy state jumps to the lower energy
          state, and will loose a portion of its energy equal to the difference
          of energy levels (usually adjacent).

X-ray tubes are the most common method of producing X-rays. An X-ray tube is a
vacuum tube that produces X-rays when an electric current passes through it.

### Biological Effects of Radiations

- Occurs due to ionization of atoms and breaking of chemical bonds.
- Depends on:
    1. Duration of exposure
    1. Dose rate i.e. rate of exposure; how fast is the radiation
    1. Dose of exposure
    1. Type of radiation $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, or X)$
        > the difference between these forms of ionizing radiation lies in
        > their origin, energy, and penetration ability. $\alpha$ particles are
        > the least penetrating, followed by $\beta$ particles, X-rays, and
        > then $\gamma$-rays, which are the most penetrating. $\alpha$ &
        > $\beta$ radiations are emitted only be certain radio isotopes,
        > $X$-rays and $\gamma$-rays originate from matter and nuclei
        > respectively.
    1. Cell sensitivity
    1. Individual sensitivity
    1. The specific body tissues that the X-ray is exposed.
- Exposure type
    1. Acute Exposure -> High dosage over short time
    1. Chronic Exposure -> Sustained low dosage over longer periods

The biological effects can be 

1. Somatic effects
    - To the individual who is exposed to the radiation itself.
    - Hair loss, cataract, premature aging, cancer, erythema and even death in
      case of radiation shower (head to toe) are examples.
    - Amongst these somatic effects, hair loss, erythema and death (not
      probable) are prompt effects due to acute exposure whilst cataract and
      cancer are rather delayed effects of chronic exposure.
1. Genetic effects
    - Future generations of the exposed individuals; offspring may acquire
      abnormalities
    - Genetic effects such as genetic mutations have not been yet seen in human
      begins. However, these have occurred in other plants and animals. So the
      chances of genetic effects in human beings are predicted to be high.
1. Stochastic effects
    - Random effects that do not have a threshold
    - Both somatic as well as genetic are stochastic effects of radiation
1. Deterministic effects
    - Effects of radiation that are seen, only when a certain threshold has
      been crossed, and that threshold is usually extremely high.
    - Deterministic effects include lethal mutations that have effects on a
      large number of cells
    - Acute Radiation Syndrome
        1. Hematologic syndrome
        1. GI syndrome -> death within 10 days
        1. CNS syndrome -> most fatal; death within a few hours

### Control and Indicating Equipment

* Control Equipments:

    1. Lead aprons
    1. Lead shields
    1. Collimation/Collimeters
        - Collimation is the process of narrowing the beam of X-rays to limit
          exposure to only the necessary area. This helps to minimize the
          amount of radiation absorbed by the body.
    1. Dosimeters
        - Devices that measure the amount of radiation that a person is exposed
          to.
    1. Time, kV and mA control
    1. Distance control
    1. Filter materials
    1. Grids

* Indicating Equipments
    1. X-ray film
    1. Fluorosocopy
    1. Image intensifiers
    1. Digital detectors
    1. Radiation monitors

#### Radiation Protection

The primary objective of radiation protection is to minimize the risks for the
people (patient and personnel) & the environment, generated by the use of
ionizing radiation by reducing stochastic as much as possible and completely
eliminating deterministic effects.

**Guidelines for radiation protection by ICRP (International Commission on
Radiological Protection):**

- 3 Principles:
    1. Justification of practice
        - How to justify the practice?
        - The benefits of using X-rays must outweigh the potential risks when
          used appropriately and with proper safety measures in place.
    1. Optimization of protection
        - ALARA stands for "As Low As Reasonably Achievable." It's a principle
          that refers to the idea of keeping exposure of ionizing radiation as
          low as possible, consistent with achieving the desired outcome. In
          practice, this means using engineering controls, administrative
          controls, and safe work practices to minimize exposure and protect
          workers and the public.
        - Minimize time of _continuous_ exposure (different from instant
          exposure; of course instant exposure also has it's effects)
        - Maximize the distance between the subject and the source of radiation
          (pertaining to the inverse square law)
        - Implement shielding (whenever possible)
            1. Gonadal shielding - testes and ovaries
            1. Personnel shielding 
            1. X-ray tube shielding
            1. Structural shielding - primary and secondary barriers
    1. Application of individual dose limits
        - Dose limits and recommended dose limits by ICRP

The benefits of using X-rays must outweigh the potential risks when used
appropriately and with proper safety measures in place.

## Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

1. Big magnet with really really high magnetic field strength. In Nepal, MRI
   magnets have strength up to 3T whilst, magnets with field strengths up to
   10T available in foreign countries.

## Ultrasound (USG)
